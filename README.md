# EC 463 - Software Mini Project by Emma Howard (emmabh97) and Mohammed Uddin (muddin1)
Senior Design software miniproject. Practice working in a Agile development environment, and working with cloud databases.

## Home Climate - Getting Started

Home Climate is inspired by EC 463 (senior design course at Boston University) to practice working within a small team setting to develop an application that stores/retrieves data on cloud databases. Following the Agile development cycle, we worked on defining requirements and concurrently working on the backend and UI design in our first sprint. After some preliminary gains, in our second sprint we worked to integrate the frontend to the back end.

The app features include user authentication through a Google sign-in, individualized data from simulated sensors that track humidity and temperature, and a plot of most recently recorded/fetched data.
